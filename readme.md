# Histopathologic Cancer Detection Assignment

## Week 3 Assignment

### CSCA 5642 - Introduction to Deep Learning

Here you will find my submission. There is a Jupyter notebook. To get the data, you will need to download it from Kaggle. The data is located at the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data

Unzip that data and place it in a folder called `histopathologic-cancer-detection` in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook. The notebook will read the data from there.
